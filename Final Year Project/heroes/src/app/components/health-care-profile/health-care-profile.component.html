                The accumulation of fat in the arteries responsible for transporting oxygen can cause multiple cardiovascular diseases including, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, the blood clotting in the arteries can lead to a stroke, which is life-threatening.
                
                2. Hirsutism:
                Hormonal imbalance can affect the appearance of the individual. Irrational weight gain can affect testosterone levels in women. With an increase in testosterone levels, women can notice abnormal hair growth on the face, chin, and other body regions where women don’t usually have hair.
                
                3. Endocrine/Metabolic Disorder:
                Type 2 diabetes correlates with obesity. Overweight people are at a higher risk of suffering from pre-diabetes and diabetes that affects the functioning of other organs.
                
                4. Cancer:
                Men and women above the required BMI are at a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer. Overweight women above forty have a higher chance of suffering from postmenopausal breast and prostate ovarian cancer.
                
                Additionally, men may develop esophageal adenocarcinoma and kidney cancer. Maintaining body weight is vital, or else the complications can be life-threatening.
                
                5. Psychological Disorders:
                Adolescents have to maintain a social life, which can be stressful. Girls are more likely to be bullied for their physical appearance. Peer pressure and expectations from people around them can induce anxiety.
                
                Moreover, overweight people may suffer from body dysmorphia, in which they are not happy with the way they look. It can affect their physical, mental, social, and academic life.
                
                6. Gallstones:
                The function of the gallbladder is to store the bile and help it pass through the small intestines. Due to inappropriate fat accumulation in the body, the functioning of the gallbladder gets compromised. Overweight individuals are more likely to have higher cholesterol as compared to others.
                
                The functioning of the gallbladder gets hindered and leads to the formation of gallstones. The larger gallstones can cause discomfort and pain. The removal of gallstones may only be possible through a surgical procedure in severe cases.
                
                7. Trouble Conceiving:
                Obesity can be a reason for hormonal imbalance, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, decreased libido, and sexual dysfunction in men and women. It can be difficult for the couple to conceive; if either one is suffering from complications induced by obesity.
                
                8. Sleep Apnea:
                It is a disorder in which individuals stop breathing while sleeping. Overweight people have fat accumulated near their neck, which affects the airway. Due to the shrinking of the airway, they are more prone to suffer from sleep apnea.
                
                9. Musculoskeletal Disorders:
                Keeping your bones healthy is essential to minimize the chances of osteoarthritis and other illnesses. Extra weight puts pressure on the bones; hence, the individual is more likely to suffer fractures. Other musculoskeletal disorders correlated with obesity are Blount disease, plantar fasciitis, Legg‐Calvé‐Perthes disease, and chronic lumbago.
                
                People should prioritize their overall health. Obesity is a serious health condition that increases the risk of developing a number of complications and diseases in adults and children. It should not be taken lightly, and you should engage in physical activity and good eating habits to maintain a healthy weight to avoid complications</p>
